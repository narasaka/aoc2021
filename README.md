# advent of code 2021
wanted to participate this year bcos i loved last year's advent of code. feels christmasy too.

languages i'll be using: c++ and python.

c++ bcos it became "muscle memory" ðŸ’€ and python bcos *simplicity*.

used [my c++ template for competitive programming](https://gist.github.com/narasaka/e1f01749f7df4c81b2479a5875d46bc2) and didn't use any python templates until day 14 lol, but started using a modified version of jonathan paulson's aoc template after.
